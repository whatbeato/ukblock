        <h1>sorry, this website is blocked in your country due to Ofcom regulations</h1>
        <h2>the uk goverment has set strict content regulations with the intention to try and protect children online, but with the side efect of suppressing free speech and creativity.</h2>
        <p>I would recomend you read <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/no-uks-online-safety-act-doesnt-make-children-safer-online">EFF's article</a> about this new rule.</p>
        <p>Kiwi Farms and 4chan have also challenged this rule in court. check out <a href="https://kiwifarms.st/threads/4chan-and-kiwi-farms-sue-the-uk-over-its-age-verification-law.227364/">kiwifarms's article</a> in regards to that. the UK has also tried to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/13/4chan_ofcom_fine/">fine 4chan 20,000 GBP</a> (twenty thousand great british pounds).</p>
        <p><strong>this isn't just affecting those forums.</strong> on Reddit, this law is also affecting under 18's access to <strong>journalism, conflict reporting, public health</strong> (i.e. r/periods, r/stopsmoking, r/sexualassault) <strong>and those looking for LGBTQIA+ resources in regards to identity and support.</strong> hell, even r/rickroll is blocked. <strong>read the EFF's article <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/americans-be-warned-lessons-reddits-chaotic-uk-age-verification-rollout">here.</a></strong></p>
        <h3>this should be a warning light to everyone, even those outside the UK.</h3>
        <p>the EU is currently planning to apply laws similar to this. a lot of US states currently have laws that require ID verification to access resources like these.</p>
        <p>compared to the UK's Online Safety Act, it has taken the EU 12 (twelve) years to propose this.</p>
        <h2>resources</h2>
        <p>i recommend you check out <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/age-verification">EFF's resource hub regarding age verification and age gating.</a></p>
        <p>if you'd like to access this website, i recommend <a href="https://mulvad.net/">Mullvad</a>, even though I personally don't use them, I have heard great things about them.</p>
        <p>fun fact: recommending a vpn is illegal according to ofcom, but we do not kneel to censorship, we educate.</p>
