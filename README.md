# ukblock

the uk goverment has set strict content regulations with the intention to try and protect children online, but with the side efect of suppressing free speech and creativity.

I would recomend you read [EFF's article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/no-uks-online-safety-act-doesnt-make-children-safer-online) about this new rule.

Kiwi Farms and 4chan have also challenged this rule in court. check out [kiwifarms's article](https://kiwifarms.st/threads/4chan-and-kiwi-farms-sue-the-uk-over-its-age-verification-law.227364/) in regards to that. the UK has also tried to [fine 4chan 20,000 GBP](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/13/4chan_ofcom_fine/) (twenty thousand great british pounds).

**this isn't just affecting those forums.** on Reddit, this law is also affecting under 18's access to **journalism, conflict reporting, public health** (i.e. r/periods, r/stopsmoking, r/sexualassault) **and those looking for LGBTQIA+ resources in regards to identity and support.** hell, even r/rickroll is blocked. **read the EFF's article [here.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/americans-be-warned-lessons-reddits-chaotic-uk-age-verification-rollout)**

the EU is currently planning to apply laws similar to this. a lot of US states currently have laws that require ID verification to access resources like these.

compared to the UK's Online Safety Act, it has taken the EU 12 (twelve) years to propose this.

## want to block the uk too?
if you'd like to redirect them to a website that explains everything **feel free to use this one!**. cloudflare allows you to setup a rule just like that.

this website also has versions in both portuguese and english.
